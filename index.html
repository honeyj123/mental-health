<h1>Mental Health Services in Ethiopia </h1>
<p> In Ethiopia,it's estimated that 18% of adults and 15% of children are affected by major mental illness or substance abuse disorders.
Though this number Ethiopia still remained one of those African countries that don't have a mental health programme.
<br> <!--<img width="500" height="400"

Most Ethiopians use traditional methods to treat mental illness and those who seeks to use modern treatments usually do 
so only after trying several traditional means.<br> Past challenges have been the lack of mental health specialists and the
poor quality of services provided for mental, neurological and substance used disorders.<br>Families and other concerned individuals 
are closely involved in the care of people who are mentally ill.However, many families keep relatives with an acute, severe illness 
at home under restraint. This aggravate the problem.
In addition, people suffering from mental illness are often the most marginalized, and affected by stigma and discrimination.

<h2>Government Commitment for Mental Healthcare</h2>


<div>  
 <P>Despite these hindrance the government has shown strong commitment for improving mental healthcare  and providing services 
    for people needing them, not only by developing mental health strategy, but also by allocating new funds to apply the strategy.
    Contribution for scaling up these services include country ownership, community ownership, and integration 
    of mental health services into existing health systems.
    The Federal Ministry of Health has also worked hard to build partnership with the World Health Organization,
    the European Union and Foundations which promote international projects and partnerships in the fields of mental health.   
</P>
</div> 
<sub>A critical requirement for the mental health promotion is to have information, increase mental health 
    services, trained skilled workers, education and self confidence to access available services.
    The key policy rapid actions needed.</sub>

<p>This audio is dedicated  for those who are in a merge giving up and sad.
I want them to see the world isn't black and white, rather it's colorful.
And there is always other sides of something that we never know till we try.
So let's just hang on and never give up!  </p><br>
